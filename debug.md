# Debug Analysis for test_send_messages.py from combined.log
Based on the provided logs, I can identify several issues in your chat service implementation:

### 1. SSE Parsing Errors

There are numerous errors related to JSON parsing in the streaming server-sent events (SSE):

```
Error parsing SSE chunk: Unexpected token \ in JSON at position XX
```

This suggests that the JSON strings being sent in your SSE stream contain escape characters that aren't properly handled. The backslashes in your JSON strings are causing parsing issues.

### 2. Credit Service Integration Issues

There's a consistent error with calls to the accounting service:

```
Error checking user credits: Request failed with status code 400
Message: Missing or invalid required fields
```

The API call to `http://accounting-service-accounting-service-1:3001/api/credits/check` is failing because you're sending an empty JSON object `{}` when the API expects certain fields:

```
data: "{}"
```

### 3. MongoDB Validation Failure

After the stream ends, there's a validation error:

```
Error updating session after stream end: ChatSession validation failed: messages.9.content: Path `content` is required.
```

This indicates that the message content is empty when trying to save the streamed response to the database.

### 4. Nova Response Format Issue

Looking at your `extractTextFromChunk` function problem and the actual logged chunks, I see the format for Nova models is different:

```
Received chunk data for amazon.nova-micro-v1:0: {"contentBlockDelta":{"delta":{"text":"s.\n- **Transportation"},"contentBlockIndex":130}}
```

Amazon Nova models use a format with `contentBlockDelta.delta.text` for the text content, which aligns with what we discussed in your earlier question.

### Recommendations:

1. **Fix the JSON parsing issue**: Make sure your SSE handler properly handles escaping in JSON. Instead of parsing the raw chunks directly, you might need to process them differently or use a dedicated SSE parser library.

2. **Fix the credit service call**: Send the required parameters to the credit check API:
   ```javascript
   {
     userId: "user-id",
     modelId: "model-id",
     // other required fields
   }
   ```

3. **Fix the message saving**: Ensure that the content field isn't empty before saving to MongoDB. Add validation to check if the streamed content is non-empty.

4. **Update the `extractTextFromChunk` function**: Your implementation needs to correctly handle the Nova format as we discussed earlier.

The service is working partially (it's generating responses) but there are several integration issues between components that need to be addressed.
