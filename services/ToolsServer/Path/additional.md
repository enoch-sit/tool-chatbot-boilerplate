Absolutely!  
Let’s **explicitly specify the relationships between street nodes**, their compass order, and the buildings/landmarks you see as you walk along the streets—block by block, node by node, always using NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST for orientation.

## **D. Example: Walking from West Street South Node (W7) to West Street North Node (W1)**

1. **Start at W7 (SOUTH end):**
   - **Post Office** (WEST), **Train Station** (EAST)
2. **Walk NORTH to W6:**  
   - **Book Shop** on your **right** (EAST)
3. **Walk NORTH to W5:**  
   - **Hospital** on your **right** (EAST)
4. **Walk NORTH to W4:**

## **F. In Table Format (West Street Example)**

| Node | Compass Relation | North Neighbor | South Neighbor | East Side Landmark | West Side Landmark |
|------|------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| W1   | North-most       | —             | W2            | Intersection (N1)  | —                  |
| W2   |                  | W1            | W3            | —                  | Police Station     |
| W3   |                  | W2            | W4            | —                  | Church             |
| W4   |                  | W3            | W5            | —                  | —                  |
| W5   |                  | W4            | W6            | Hospital           | —                  |
| W6   |                  | W5            | W7            | Book Shop          | —                  |
| W7   | South-most       | W6            | —             | Train Station      | Post Office        |

## **G. Visual Walk Example (with Sides Noted)**

**If you walk NORTH along West Street from W7 to W1:**

- **Left (WEST):** Post Office (W7), Church (W3), Police Station (W2)
- **Right (EAST):** Train Station (W7), Book Shop (W6), Hospital (W5)
- **At W1:** Intersection with North Street (EAST)

---

## **Summary**

- **Every node has a compass relationship to its neighbors ("W1 is north of W2", etc.)**
- **For each block, you know which building is on your left/right (compass side)**
- **Junctions are explicit nodes for turning between streets**

**Let me know if you want this as a Python data structure, or for any other street!**
