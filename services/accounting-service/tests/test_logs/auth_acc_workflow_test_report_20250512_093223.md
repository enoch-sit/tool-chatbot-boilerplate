## JWT Information Flow Details

### User Registration Flow

1. User is registered in Authentication service
2. Email verification is completed
3. Authentication service marks user as verified

### Login and JWT Issuance

1. Authentication service verifies user credentials
2. JWT token is generated containing user ID, username, email, and role
3. JWT is signed with a secret shared by both services
4. Token is returned to the client for subsequent requests

### Cross-Service Authentication

1. Client sends JWT in Authorization header to either service
2. Each service independently verifies the JWT signature using the shared secret
3. User identity and permissions are extracted from the validated token
4. No direct database queries between services - only JWT data is trusted

### First-Time User in Accounting Service

1. When a user first accesses the Accounting service, their JWT is validated
2. If the user doesn't exist in the Accounting database, a new record is created
3. User identity information is extracted from the JWT payload
4. This allows seamless user creation across services without shared databases

## JWT Security Notes

- All services share the same JWT secret for token verification
- Services don't share database access - they only trust validated JWT tokens
- User data flows through JWT payloads, not through direct database queries
- Only the Authentication Service can issue new tokens
