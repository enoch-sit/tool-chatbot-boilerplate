# Foreign Key Constraints and Cross-Service Data Integrity

## Problem Overview

When building microservice architectures, one common challenge is maintaining data consistency across services. In our Auth-Accounting workflow, we encountered a foreign key constraint issue that prevented users from receiving credit allocations. This guide explains the problem, diagnosis, and solution.

## Background

Our system consists of two primary services:

1. **Authentication Service**: Manages user accounts and authentication (using MongoDB)
2. **Accounting Service**: Handles credit allocation and usage tracking (using PostgreSQL)

In our workflow, a user registers in the Auth service and then receives initial credits through the Accounting service. However, the test scenario kept failing with this error:

```
ERROR: Credit allocation failed: {"message":"Failed to allocate credits"}
```

## Diagnosing the Problem

We examined the Docker logs and found the root cause:

```
SequelizeForeignKeyConstraintError: insert or update on table "credit_allocations" violates foreign key constraint "credit_allocations_user_id_fkey"
...
detail: 'Key (user_id)=(680f35c2fd53771548d9a8dd) is not present in table "user_accounts".'
```

The issue was a **foreign key constraint** in the `credit_allocations` table of the Accounting service's PostgreSQL database. It was requiring that any user receiving credits must already exist in the `user_accounts` table of the Accounting service.

However, in our workflow, users register in the Authentication service first (which uses MongoDB), and their IDs aren't automatically synchronized to the Accounting service's PostgreSQL database.

## Database Schema Analysis

Looking at the models:

```typescript
// credit-allocation.model.ts
userId: {
  type: DataTypes.STRING(50),
  allowNull: false,
  references: {
    model: 'user_accounts', 
    key: 'user_id'  // Foreign key reference
  }
}
```

This created a **dependency coupling** between services - the Accounting service couldn't function independently without synchronized user data from the Auth service.

## Solution Approaches

We considered several solutions:

1. **Trigger-based approach**: Create a database trigger that automatically creates user accounts when needed
2. **Code-based approach**: Modify the application code to ensure user accounts exist before allocation
3. **Database patch approach**: Create user accounts in advance for testing scenarios
4. **Schema modification approach**: Remove the foreign key constraint

## Implementation Details

We chose the **schema modification approach** as the most reliable and maintainable solution. We removed the foreign key constraint to allow the Accounting service to operate more independently from the Auth service.

### Step 1: Created a PowerShell script to remove the constraint

```powershell
# PowerShell script to remove the foreign key constraint
$sqlPatchContent = @"
-- Drop the foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE credit_allocations 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS credit_allocations_user_id_fkey;

-- Inform the user of the changes
SELECT 'Foreign key constraint removed successfully.' as result;
"@

# Copy SQL to Docker container and execute it
Get-Content $sqlFilePath | docker exec -i accounting-service-postgres-1 sh -c 'cat > /tmp/fix_db_schema.sql'
docker exec accounting-service-postgres-1 psql -U postgres -d accounting_db -f /tmp/fix_db_schema.sql
```

### Step 2: Modified the user account creation process

We also enhanced the application's user account handling. When a user from the Auth service accesses the Accounting service, we now:

1. First check if the user exists in our database
2. If not, create a placeholder account with basic information
3. Then proceed with operations like credit allocation

This ensures that data from the Auth service can be used properly in the Accounting service without strict schema constraints.

## Key Insights and Best Practices

This experience highlights several important principles in microservice architecture:

### 1. Service Independence

**Problem**: The foreign key constraint created a tight coupling between services.

**Best Practice**: Services should be able to function independently without strict database-level dependencies on other services.

### 2. Eventual Consistency

**Problem**: We expected immediate consistency between Auth and Accounting databases.

**Best Practice**: In microservice architectures, it's better to design for eventual consistency. Data will synchronize over time rather than immediately.

### 3. Graceful Degradation

**Problem**: The system was failing completely when user data wasn't synchronized.

**Best Practice**: Design systems to work with incomplete data, creating placeholders when needed rather than failing entirely.

### 4. Foreign Key Trade-offs

**Problem**: The foreign key constraint enforced referential integrity but reduced flexibility.

**Best Practice**: Consider carefully whether foreign key constraints are appropriate when:
- The referenced data originates in a different service
- The referenced data may not be immediately available
- Services need to operate independently

## Testing the Solution

After implementing our solution, the Auth-Accounting workflow test passed successfully:

```
[2025-04-28 16:04:17] INFO: Allocating credits to test user ID: 680f3681fd53771548d9a8ee
[2025-04-28 16:04:17] SUCCESS: Credit allocation successful, ID: 4
[2025-04-28 16:04:17] SUCCESS: User balance verified: 100 credits
[2025-04-28 16:04:17] SUCCESS: âœ… User account was automatically created in Accounting service
```

## Alternative Approaches

If you prefer to maintain referential integrity, consider these alternatives:

1. **Event-driven synchronization**: When a user is created in Auth service, publish an event that the Accounting service consumes to create a corresponding record

2. **Service-to-service communication**: When allocating credits, have the Accounting service call the Auth service to verify the user exists

3. **Shared database**: In simpler architectures, consider using a shared database schema (though this reduces service independence)

## Conclusion

This case demonstrates a common challenge in microservice architectures: balancing data integrity with service independence. Our solution prioritized service independence by removing the foreign key constraint while still maintaining application-level data validation.

Remember that there's no one-size-fits-all approach - the right solution depends on your specific requirements for data consistency, service independence, and operational resilience.
