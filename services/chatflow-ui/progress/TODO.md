# Differential building strategy

the problem is bridge can be run npm run build and interact-bridge-ui can not be build.
but what I want is interact-bridge-ui
I want you to

1) For each dependency in `interact-bridge-ui`, identify the code that uses it.
2) Install the dependency into the `bridge` project.
3) Copy the corresponding code from `interact-bridge-ui` to `bridge`.
4) Attempt to build the `bridge` project to verify the changes.
5) For each step (adding a library, updating code), write your notes in `progress.md`.
6) In general no need to seek my approval, only update the progress.md
7) Do not delete any code, only copy.

## update

no need to seek my approval, I approve all your actions, please proceed
